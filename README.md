# Image Providers
* [Unsplash](#unsplash)
## Unsplash
> Note: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) is the default and the only (for now) image provider for `wallpapr`.

`wallpapr` uses the [`/photo/random`](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo) API provided by [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) to get the random image. The configurations are a subset of the ones described for the API in the [Unsplash official documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation#parameters-10).

### Setup Unsplash as Image Provider
1. [Register](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account) an Unsplash app and get the secret key and access key.
2. Export the secret key (as `UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY`) and access key (as `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`).
```bash
$ export UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY="secret_key"
$ export UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="access_key"
```
> Note: You can add these command at the end of ~/.profile to export it globally for the current user.
> This is required for wallpapr cli.
3. Once `wallpapr` is installed set `image_provider` to `unsplash` in the configuration file. See [configuring wallpapr](#configuring-wallpapr).

### Unsplash Configuration
